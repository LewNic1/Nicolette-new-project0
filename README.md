Technologies used- started from scratch; currently only using html and css.

My process: I initally downloaded and began my project using the HTML5 Boilerplate to get started. After a lot of frustration and hours of not understanding or knowing why some of my code was not working I decided to trash it and start over.  Starting from scratch has been a long process for me but has given me more of an undersatnding of HTML and CSS. 

Unsolved problems: Creating my carousal, adding JavaScript and styling.

Biggest wins & challenges are both the same for me. Getting started with the project; increasing my understanding with flexbox and css.
